Reading [Sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) in wikipedia

I read this article for making the validator of proofs in LK/LJ. So I would occasionally skip the part which is irrelavant to LK or LJ.

- Hilbert style proof calculus
  - Each line is an unconditional tautology = theorem.
- Gentzen style proof calculus
  - Each line is a conditional tautology. Conditions are on the left.
  - Natural deduction
    - every line has exactly one assertion on the right.
  - Sequent calculus
    - every line has zero or more assertions on the right.

Hilbert style has only a few rules, but needs many axioms. Gentzen style have more rules than Hilbert style, but needs fewer axioms.
