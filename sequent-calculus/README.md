Reading [Sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) in wikipedia

I read this article for making the validator of proofs in LK/LJ. So I would occasionally skip the part which is irrelavant to LK or LJ.

- Hilbert style proof calculus
  - Each line is an unconditional tautology = theorem.
- Gentzen style proof calculus
  - Each line is a conditional tautology. Conditions are on the left.
  - Natural deduction
    - every line has exactly one assertion on the right.
  - Sequent calculus
    - every line has zero or more assertions on the right.

Hilbert style has only a few rules, but needs many axioms. Gentzen style have more rules than Hilbert style, but needs fewer axioms.

- LK was introduced in 1934.
- LJ was introduced in 1935.

The cut elimination theorem on LK and LJ is called Gentzen's Hauptsatz. It is later used to prove the consistency of Peano arithmetics.

- Sequent calculi (ie LK and LJ) are also called Gentzen's systems.

(Hilbert's system seems a little different from sequent calculi)

- Natural deduction
  - Judgement is a form, A0, ..., An |- B
- Sequent Calculus
  - Sequent is a form, A0, ..., An |- B0, ..., Bn

(Gentzen's system is more similar to what mathematicians do to proove theorems in practice.)
