In this directory, I'm going to take notes on reading "Introduction of Commutative Algebra" by M. F. Atiyah and I. G. Macdonald.


The book is available at, for example:
- US: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201407515
- Japan: https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/0201407515


# Introduction

According to the author, commutative algebra was derived from the two sources: algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory.

The central idea of commutative algebra is prime ideal according to the auther. Prime ideals are the generalization of prime numbers in arithmetic. The author says "near a point" in geometrical sense and "localizing" a ring at a prime ideal are similar. I have no idea about this at all, but the author seems trying to say that prime ideals in algebra and points in geometry are similar. What an incredible analogy ðŸ¤¯

The author credited J. P. Serre and J. Tate as the pioneers of the domain.
